# DIUride: Enhancing Campus Transportation through Ride Sharing.
# Descripton :
The DIUride is a smartphone software specifically designed to meet the transportation 
needs of Daffodil International University students, offering them a quick and efficient 
ride-sharing alternative. The main objective is to engage students who have bikes and 
want to share rides. And those who want a hassle free journey with the benefit of ride 
share. This mobile application offers a user-friendly interface, facilitating DIU students in 
effortlessly booking rides within the university's transportation network. Commencing 
with an engaging splash screen, it seamlessly navigates users to a secure login page for 
accessing their accounts. Students can login as a rider or as a passenger. A rider can offer 
a ride along with the details of the route. Passengers can pick the ride to their location 
from the ride list and go together. Since the rider is bringing another person with him 
while heading to his destination, he will share the journey for considerably less money. 
And travelers may have a seamless and easy ride. The rider can earn some money with 
this ride sharing app. And finally this system will boost the relationship between student 
in the campus and save their valuable time.
